Build notes

* How to upgrade FCKEditor
    * Extract the archive of FCKEditor under src/temp/fckeditor
    * Run the "update" task of the src/build.xml ant build file. Check properties value before, they might need adjustment.
    * Of course, check diffs. A full-blown diff is generated by the ant build in temp/current.diff
    * Make sure the files under src/main/resources/mgnl-resources/fckeditor/custom are still consistent. The skin folder,
      for instance, must contain a copy of the fck_dialog_ie6.js file which also exists under fckeditor/editor/skins/*;
      the fck_strip.gif file is a copy from the one found in fckeditor/editor/skins/default.
