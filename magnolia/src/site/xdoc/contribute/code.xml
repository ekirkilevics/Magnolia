				Code contributions in its various forms are very welcome - check our list of ideas!

				easy, safe and you get to use a machine that was invented more than 160 years ago -
				the fax machine, patented in 1843. (of course you can also use the even older postal
				service, first established in China 900 BC).

			<subsection name="Create patches">
				<p>
					If you found a bug, you are welcome to fix it. Once you have made sure that it
					actually fixes the problem, send the patch to the core developer list, where one
					of the committers will take care of it.

			<subsection name="Share your paragraph templates">
				<p>
					If you have programmed a nice custom paragraph that might be useful either as an
					example or "as is", think about sharing it with others. You only need to provide
					the code and a description.

			<subsection name="Share site templates">
				<p>
					You might have designed a really nice site and don't mind that others take it as
					a starting point? Why not upload the complete site templates to magnolia.info?

			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Develop modules">
				<p>
					You can develop modules. Modules are meant to extend the Magnolia core and use
					the Magnolia module API. You are welcome to share your modules on magnolia.info,
					either for free (open source modules) or as commercial modules. Simply register
					as a Magnolia partner and add your module to the magnolia shop - this is the
					easiest way to sell your Magnolia modules, and it benefits you as well as
					Magnolia.
