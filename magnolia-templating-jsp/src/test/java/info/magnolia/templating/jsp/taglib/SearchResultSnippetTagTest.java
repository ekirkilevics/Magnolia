                "\n" +
                "With **Magnolia 4.0**, we decided to add support for Freemarker for several reasons: not only for its flexibility, cleaner syntax, and better error reporting, but also for the fact that it does not depend on the file system: templates don't have to be extracted to the file system, so they can easily be stored in the repository, versioned, and so on. Since the AdminCentral was already built using Freemarker, and we had experimental support for Freemarker paragraphs, it was really the next logical move.\n" +
                "However, this doesn't mean we're dropping support for JSP-based templates. As a matter of fact, you can mix and match templates and paragraphs using both templating mechanisms at will.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Freemarker is easy to learn, and you can even use it with your regular html editing tools. Most IDEs also provide a good level of integration.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "h1. References\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Here a few useful links to get started with Freemarker:\n" +
                "* http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/docs/index.html\n" +
                "* http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/docs/dgui_quickstart_template.html - A quickstart guide for templating.\n" +
                "* http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/docs/ref_builtins.html - Built-ins are the {{?bits}} following expressions and providing useful functionality.\n" +
                "* http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/docs/ref_directives.html - Directives are {{\\[#blocks]}} of code which can be assimilated to jsp tags.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "h1. Introduction\n" +
                "\n" +
                "h2. Directives\n" +
                "Freemarker has a number of {link:directives|http://freemarker.org/docs/dgui_template_directives.html} to help structure your templates: {{if}}, {{else}}, {{list}}, etc.. Directives are {{\\[#someDirective]...\\[/#directive]}} blocks or {{\\[#otherDirective]}} tags. Note that FreeMarker supports two syntaxes, using either {{\\[}} or {{<}} delimiters. We favor the former for clarity and because it makes HTML editors happier, but you will notice that the FreeMarker documentation uses the latter as a default. Both are interchangeable but one template has to stick to one syntax.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The {link:complete list|http://freemarker.org/docs/ref_directives.html} is available in the FreeMarker documentation. The following few directives should get you a long way: {{\\[#assign]}}, {{\\[#if]}} {{\\[#else]}}, {{\\[#list]}} & {{\\[#include]}}.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Be sure to check the documentation, you might find nice little surprises, such as the fact that the {{list}} directive expose 2 useful extra variables in the loop: {{item_index}} & {{item_has_next}}.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "h2. Expressions\n" +
                "Very similar to the JSP expressions {{$\\{somevar\\}}} you can access the available objects/variables. You can access all properties by the simple dot notation  {{$\\{bean.prop\\}}}. In addition you are able to call methods {{$\\{util.method(param1, param2)\\}}}\n" +
                "\n" +
                "h2. Default values\n" +
                "FreeMarker offers a nice little syntactic sugar to handle default values: you can use the {{!}} operator: {{$\\{content.title!\"no title\"\\}}}. They can be chained and the following example would either output the title, the name of the page or a default string: {{$\\{content.title!content.@name!\"no title\"\\}}}.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "h2. Null\n" +
                "Freemarker does not allow you to render null values (will throw an exception). If you expect a value to be null you can also use the ! operator: {{$\\{content.title!\\}}}. This is the equivalent to {{$\\{content.title!''\\}}}.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "h2. Built-ins\n" +
                "FreeMarker is in contrast to JSP optimized for writing templates (especially HTML). There are many so called built ins you can call on a variable by using the {{?}} notation.\n" +
                "\n" +

If no matching template is found, then it will be loaded from the classpath. We also provide a {javadoc:info.magnolia.freemarker.loaders.LazyFileTemplateLoader} implementation, which allows your templates to be loaded from an arbitrary location on the file system. Custom template loaders are of course also useable.
