The build command is :

    mvn clean install

and not "mvn war" as advertised on the web site.




To make things smoother :


* make sure to remove any gcj binding (as root do) :

  # rm /usr/bin/java*


* make sure to set your JAVA_HOME correctly

  $ export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/java


* the maven build process will call the 'java' command so you have
  to make sure that your PATH points to the right 'java'

  $ export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin/

  (you have to make sure there's no other 'java_home bin' in your PATH)


* if for some reason, a test suite doesn't run, erase its test/ dir.
  (dirty workaround but may spare you time) Please report this in Jira
  and/or the developers mailing list.


* Java 5 is required for building. The reason is we use it for unit tests.
  This has no impact on production code, which is compiled for Java 1.4.
  See the main pom.xml for details on how this is done.
