============
kupu credits
============

* Maik Jablonski

  - wrote the original Epoz rich text editor (for Zope2/Plone)

* Paul Everitt

  - JavaScript God

  - made the original proposal to refactor Kupu using Page Template
    macros and XML configuration.

  - much of the initial hacking, conversion to OO, async saving etc.

* Philipp von Weitershausen

  - Came up with the directory structure that lets Kupu be both a
    Zope2 and Zope3 product

  - Internationalization

  - Zope2, CMF, Plone and Zope3 integration

  - Administrative tasks, thanks again Philipp...

* Guido Wesdorp

  - Mr. Kupu :)

  - Maintainer, bugfixer and feature adder

  - Came up with the idea to make Kupu server-independent (runs on
    'plain' webservers such as Apache now)

  - Came up with the idea for the cleanup functionality that uses
    browser's DOM functionality to get well-formed XML out of Kupu

  - Improved table support, link support, etc.

  - Refactored the kupu editor to MVC-like components, making it much
    more flexible for customization.

  - Silva integration (most of that is in Silva itself, though)

  - Implemented context menus.

* Duncan Booth

  - Much work on Plone support.

* Third party products included:

  - Sarissa ECMAScript library written by Manos Batsis, released under
    the Kupu License with kind permission by the author. See the Sarissa
    homepage at http://sarissa.sourceforge.net for more information.

* Also thanks to:

  - Holger Krekel for being so kind to provide resources on his Codespeak

  - Eric Casteleijn for the new name.

  - Igor Stroh for some bugfixes.

  - Jan Smith for finding bugs (and believe us, she did! ;)
