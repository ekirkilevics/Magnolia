Build notes

* How to upgrade FCKEditor

    * Extract the archive of FCKEditor under src/main/resources/mgnl-resources/fckeditor

    * Remove the following:

      * **/_*.*

      * htaccess.txt

      * fckeditor.{afp|asp|cfc|cfm|lasso|php|pl|py}

      * src/main/resources/mgnl-resources/fckeditor/editor/filemanager/browser/default/connectors/* (we use custom stuff)

      * src/main/resources/mgnl-resources/fckeditor/editor/filemanager/upload/* (we use custom stuff)

    * Everything that's under src/main/resources/mgnl-resources/fckeditor/custom should remain, since, as the name states, it is custom

    * If they have not yet been applied to the main fck sources, apply the patches found in src/patches.

    * Of course, check diffs and adapt any customized file that might have changed.
