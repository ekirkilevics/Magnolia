                Discussion on the developer list centers around building the best content management system in the
                world. If you want to know how to do whatever with Magnolia, this is the wrong place to ask, and if you
                get an answer at all, it will probably be spelled: "you are on the wrong list". Check out the user-list
                instead.

                    <li>
                        We accept attachments on this list, and therefore have to allow "HTML" mail. However, please set
                        your email client to send plain text email. If you are a windows user, by default that
                        requirement will not be met.

                        Trim your replies. That means do not simply hit "Reply" and start typing. Remove anything that
                        is not directly relevant to your reply before you start typing. We all have the previous mail in
                        our inbox,there is no need to have the whole thread copied into each reply.

                        Be concise - provide as much detail as necessary and as little as possible to state your case.
