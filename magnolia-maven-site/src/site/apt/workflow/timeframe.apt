**Proof of concept (6 man#weeks)

*-----+------+
Embed the engine | Create a magnolia module called workflow with the openWfe
*-----+------+
JCR Persistency | Persist into a separate JCR repository (workflow) the following: workitem store and expression store as described in {{integration_openWFE.html#persitency}}
*-----+------+
Create participants | Mapping defined into the openwfe section. {{integration_openWFE.html#participant}}, embedded participant will be registered by the engine. Ask {{{mailto:john@openwfe.org}John}}
*-----+------+
Workflow Inbox | Use JCR queries to create the Inbox.  
*-----+------+
Proof of concept | Create activate remote XML-RPC call that sends an email to see if this is working. (Activate actually starts a flow based on a flow definition)
*-----+------+

**Finish implementation (6 man#weeks)

*-----+------+
Extend the AdminTreeMVCHandler | With common code from the above as a start to refactor into commands.
*-----+------+
Remote Interface | Create the other XML-RPC calls as described in {{api.html#Workflow}}
*-----+------+
Commands | Using Commons Chains to define command mapping 
*-----+------+
Magnolia Remote Commands | Create a handler to expose the magnolia commands as XML-RPC calls.
*-----+------+
