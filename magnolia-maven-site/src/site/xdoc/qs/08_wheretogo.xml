            	Places to explore:
            	<ul>
            		<li>The <b>samples-template</b> we provide will give you a lot of ideas how to proceed, 
            		as it is considerable more complex than the examples above, and includes amongst others 
            		a mail form paragraph that allows you to create arbitrary forms.</li>
            		<li>The <b>tag libraries</b> - check out separate documentation or the source code 
            		to see which tags the Magnolia tag libraries provide to make templating in JSP easier. 
            		(Also check out the standard JSTL).</li>
