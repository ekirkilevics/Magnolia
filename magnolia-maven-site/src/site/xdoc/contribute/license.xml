                The contribution license is inspired (i.e. copied and adapted) from the Apache Contributor License
                Agreement, as is the following reasoning for requiring such a license:

            <p>
                Magnolia International desires that all contributors of ideas, code, or documentation to the Magnolia
                projects complete, sign, and submit (via mail or fax) a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). The purpose
                of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed
                to Magnolia International and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute
                regarding the software at some future time. A signed CLA is required to be on file before an individual
                is given commit rights to a Magnolia project.

            <p>
                Thank you for your interest in Magnolia International. In order to clarify the intellectual property
                license granted with contributions of software from any person or entity (the "Contributor"), Magnolia
                International would like to have a Contributor License Agreement on file that has been signed by the
                Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a
                Contributor of software to Magnolia International and does not change your right to use your own
                contributions for any other purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have not already done so, please complete this Agreement and send it by facsimile to Magnolia
                International at +41-61-228-9001, or send a photocopy by regular mail to Magnolia International,
                Binningerstrasse 15, 4051 Basel, Switzerland. Please read this document carefully before signing and
                keep the original for your records.

            <p>You and Magnolia International hereby accept and agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Your "Contributions" means all of your past, present and future contributions of object code, source
                    code and documentation to Magnolia International, however submitted to Magnolia International,
                    excluding any submissions that are conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as
                    "Not a Contribution."

                <li>
                    You hereby grant to Magnolia International a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, no-charge,
                    transferable copyright license to use, execute, prepare derivative works of, and distribute
                    (internally and externally, in object code and, if included in your Contributions, source code form)
                    your Contributions. Except for the rights granted to Magnolia International in this paragraph, You
                    reserve all right, title and interest in and to your Contributions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) have
                    rights to intellectual property that you create, you represent that you have received permission to
                    make the Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that your employer has waived such rights for
                    your Contributions to the Foundation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You represent that, except as disclosed in your Contribution submission(s), each of your
                    Contributions is your original creation. You represent that your Contribution submission(s) include
                    complete details of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents
                    and trademarks) associated with any part of your Contribution(s) (including a copy of any applicable
                    license agreement). You agree to notify Magnolia International of any facts or circumstances of
                    which you become aware that would make Your representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any
                    respect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You are not expected to provide support for your Contributions, except to the extent you desire to
                    provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Your Contributions are
                    provided as-is, with all faults defects and errors, and without warranty of any kind (either express
                    or implied) including, without limitation, any implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for a
                    particular purpose and any warranty of non-infringement.
