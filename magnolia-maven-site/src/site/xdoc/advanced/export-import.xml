			<p>
				One should not copy repository files while magnolia is running, 
				at least not via the file system, since magnolia might be 
				writing to the repository while you copy it; which would lead 
				to an inconsistent copy of the repository.
			</p>
			<p>
				To make a backup at runtime you should export the
				repository contents. Note that <b>currently only the most recent version 
				of your data gets imported.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				You can import and export data using the context-menu in the 
				navigation tree or you can use the import/export servlets which are used by the tree as well:
				<br />
				<code>/.magnolia/mgnl-export</code>
				and
				<code>/.magnolia/mgnl-import</code>
