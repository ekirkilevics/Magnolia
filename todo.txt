magnolia 2.x


SCharles :

1. better lucene integration
2. re-factor control objects (GUI)
3. Level 1 (magnolia objects caching) and Level 2 (file system caching) caching. (repository read is too slow)
4. write configuration observer (any change in configuration must be loaded without restart or any manual event)
5. repository implementation ? create file system on top of jackrabbit?. I would prefer having single file instead
   of thousands.
