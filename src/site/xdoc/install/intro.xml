                <p>
                    Magnolia 2.1 is available in two different packages:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="install-bundle.html">A preconfigured tomcat 5.x bundle</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="install-wars.html">
                                A pair of war files which can be deployed on an existing application server
                            </a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you download the tomcat bundle you will be able to run magnolia without any further
                    configuration, so this is probably the easier way to try it if you are new to magnolia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Expert developers might prefer to download the war files. Magnolia requires a servlet 2.4 compatible
                    servlet container and a 1.4 level jre/jdk (depending on the server requisites) in order to run
                    properly. The suggested server is Apache Tomcat 5.x.

            <subsection name="Nightly builds and builds from svn">
                <p>
                    Nightly builds are available as a single war (configured as an admin instance). You can install this
                    war just like the ones in the 2-war files distribution. This
                    <a href="install-build.html">install guide</a>
                    will show you how to change the configuration of a war and how to make multiple magnolia instances
                    live in the same application server.
