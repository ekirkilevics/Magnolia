			<p>The available controls are defined in the config at the following path <code>/modules/adminInterface/config/controls</code><br/>
			See the samples dialogs to get an impression how they work and how they are configurable. It is also helpfull to create a page with the 'developers' showroom' template.</p>

				<p>
					The fck editor is very new integrated and not all features are supported from
					the dialog definition.
					<br />

					But there are two importent properties available
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>jsInitFile (startup file)</li>
					<li>customConfigurationPath (config file)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Both properties are mapped by default to the magnoliaStandard.js files.
					<br />

					To configure the editor you would make two such custom files in the custom
					folder and then to point from the dialog definition to them.
					<br />

					This gives you the possibility to have a template/paragraph wise configuration.
					<br />

					FCK has a lot of features. We will make some properties like there were for the
					richEdit control (Kupu). But it is quite easy to make your own configuration
					file. Look at the original: admindocroot/fckeditor/fckconfig.js
