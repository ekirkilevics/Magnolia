            	Places to explore:
            	<ul>
            		<li>The <b>samples-template</b> we provide will give you a lot of ideas how to proceed, 
            		as it is considerable more complex than the examples above, and includes amongst others 
            		a mail form paragraph that allows you to create arbitrary forms.</li>
            		<li>The <b>tag libraries</b> - check out separate documentation or the source code 
            		to see which tags the Magnolia tag libraries provide to make templating in JSP easier. 
            		(Also check out the standard JSTL).</li>
            		<li>Check <b>www.magnolia.info</b> for updates and news as well as <b>wiki.magnolia.info</b> 
            		for community documentation.</li>
            		<li>Visit <b>jira.magnolia.info</b> to view reported bugs or feature requests and to 
            		submit your own.</li>
            		<li>Get registered on the <b>magnolia-list</b> to discuss with your fellow Magnolians
