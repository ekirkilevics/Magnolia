    the Repository element configures a repository instance;
    individual workspaces of the repository are configured through
    separate configuration files called workspace.xml which are
    located in a subfolder of the workspaces root directory
    (see Workspaces element).

    it consists of

        a FileSystem element (the virtual file system
        used by the repository to persist global state such as
        registered namespaces, custom node types, etc..

        a Workspaces element that specifies to the location of
        workspaces root directory and the name of default workspace

        a Workspace element that is used as a workspace configuration
        template; it is used to create the initial workspace if there's
        no workspace yet and for creating additional workspaces through
        the api
