                Welcome to Magnolia, and congratulations to the aspiring Magnolia templater! (that would be you).
                Building templates in Magnolia is very simple once you have acquainted yourself with the basic
                mechanisms and structures involved. This document will try to make that process as painless as possible,
                with a focus on speed vs. depth.
