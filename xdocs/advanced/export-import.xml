			<p>
				One should not copy repository files in a running system, since you can look at them
				as a common database changing at evry time. To make a backup it is saver to export.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can do this using the export import context-menupoints in the tree or you use
				the import/export servlets. This servlets are the same as thouse used in the tree:
				<br />
				<code>/.magnolia/mgnl-export</code>
				and
				<code>/.magnolia/mgnl-import</code>
