			<p>
				Magnolia does not make any guidelines about multi-languages implementations. Common
				used mechanisms are.
			</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>
					make language trees (/en/.. /de/..). This is useful if you do not have the same
					content (more often than one thinks in advance).
				</li>
				<li>
					make a tab for each language. name the attributes en_title, de_title. then in
					the template you are able to get the data dynamically.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				To make your dialogs itself multi-language capable or to get informations about the
				i18n mechanism you should go
