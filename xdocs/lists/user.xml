						We only accept plain text email on this list. If you are a windows user, by
						default that requirement will not be met. Please read

							"Configuring Mail Clients to Send Plain ASCII Text"

						to understand what is wrong with non-ASCII mail and what you can do about
						it. Even if that is the only thing you get out of visiting magnolia.info, it
						will be worth it.

						to state your case.
