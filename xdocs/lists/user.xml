                        We only accept plain text email on this list. If you are a windows user, by default that
                        requirement will not be met. Please read
                        <a href="http://expita.com/nomime.html" target="_blank">
                            "Configuring Mail Clients to Send Plain ASCII Text"
                        </a>
                        to understand what is wrong with non-ASCII mail and what you can do about it. Even if that is
                        the only thing you get out of visiting magnolia.info, it will be worth it.

                        Trim your replies. That means do not simply hit "Reply" and start typing. Remove anything that
                        is not directly relevant to your reply before you start typing. We all have the previous mail in
                        our inbox, there is no need to have the whole thread copied into each reply.

                    <li>
                        Be concise - provide as much detail as necessary and as little as possible to state your case.
