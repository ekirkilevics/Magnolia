				<b>You are welcome to join the developer list</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Discussion on the developer list centers around building the best content management
				system in the world. If you want to know how to do whatever with Magnolia, this is
				the wrong place to ask, and if you get an answer at all, it will probably be
				spelled: "you are on the wrong list". Check out the user-list instead.
			</p>
			<p>

				Now, after the above, if you are still with us, to subscribe send a mail to:
				<br />

					dev-list-subscribe@magnolia.info
				</a>
				<br />
				<br />
				to post send mails to:

				</a>

				Please note the following:
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>
						We accept attachments on this list, and therefore have to allow "HTML" mail.
						However, please set your email client to send plain text email. If you are a
						windows user, by default that requirement will not be met.
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						Please read

						to state your case.
