				If you have some time on your hands and like what you see, why not participate and
				make Magnolia even better.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are many ways you can support us:
				<a href="../../../en/magnolia/developer/contribute/spread-the-word.html"
					class="contentLink">
					spread the word
				</a>
				,
				<a href="../../../en/magnolia/developer/contribute/write-code.html"
					class="contentLink">
					write code
				</a>
				or simply share time, knowledge or funds with us. We need you!
				<br />
				<br />
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer questions on the mailing lists</span>
				<br />

				Even if you just got started with Magnolia, you might know more than the guy asking
				a question. You are very welcome to share your knowledge on our templaters mailing
				list.
			</p>
			<subsection name="Write documentation">
				<p>
					If you like to write documentation and have some time on your hands, there are
					many issues that need documenting. If you have learned something, write it down
					and share it. No need to get fancy with graphics and stuff. A small how-to in
					plain text is a good start.
					<br />
					<br />
					If you had to write documentation for your users, your IT department or your
					grandmom, why not share it with the rest of the Magnolia community. They might
					have grandmoms, too.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Translate the Magnolia User Interface">
				<p>
					Magnolia will come with an internationalization module. This allows Magnolia to
					have its user interface in any language you like. Even if you do not have the
					ambitions to completely translate Magnolia, you might have time to add a couple
					of translations or correct erraneous ones.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Report bugs">
				<p>
					If you use Magnolia and find a bug, report it. Make sure its a bug (and not
					simply a configuration issue), check the bug tracker if it has been reported
					before, and add it to the bug tracker if no one else has done so.
					<br />
					<br />
					If you don't know if something is a bug or a configuration problem, check the
					mailing list archives for similar problems. If in doubt, post it on the list,
					and if the general agreement is that its a bug, go add it to the bug tracker.
					<br />
					<br />
					Of course you are also welcome to download the latest code from CVS and test it.
					Report bugs using the bug tracker.
					<br />
					<br />
					See the feedback page for details on reporting bugs.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Other ideas? Let us know!</b>
					<br />
					Are you the creative type? Share your wicked ideas of promoting Magnolia with
					us!
