CKEditor add-on component was written initially by Yozons, Inc. (www.yozons.com)
for its Open eSignForms project (open.esignforms.com) -- not required to use this component --
which is separately licensed under the Affero GPL as well as a commercial licensed.

CKEditor add-on's code framework was initially jump-started using the Vaadin incubator
component TinyMCEEditor, replacing TinyMCE with CKEditor.  The TinyMCE code is licensed
under Apache License 2.0 and was written by Matti Tahvonen.
No changes to TinyMCEEditor were made and this component makes no use of TinyMCE.
Special thanks to TinyMCEEditor for showing a path since it was all fuzzy to us!
